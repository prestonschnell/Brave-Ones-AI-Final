# Welcome to Brave Ones!

Brave Ones is a turn-based RPG game developed using Python and PyGame, with a focus on adversarial AI behavior. The player engages in combat against enemy NPCs that can intelligently attack, heal, and respond dynamically to player actions. The game operates on a turn-delay system, where enemies and the player take turns sequentially, requiring strategic decision-making. The AI agents are designed to minimize the player’s health and maximize their chances of survival using a mix of predefined health values, potion effects, and randomized damage. Visual feedback is implemented using sprite animations for states like idle, attack, hurt, and death, enhancing the game's aesthetic and mechanical clarity. The game includes a health bar interface and employs modular coding (button system) for usability. The project showcases both gameplay design and AI logic in a visually engaging format.
