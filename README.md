## Overview
Brave Ones RPG is a turn-based battle game developed using Python and the Pygame library. The game features classic RPG mechanics such as:

🎮 Turn-based combat system with attack and potion mechanics

💥 Animated sprite rendering for idle, attack, hurt, and death states

💡 Object-Oriented Design using Fighter, HealthBar, and DamageText classes

🧠 Simple AI behavior for enemies that conditionally heal or attack

🧪 Potion system that heals players and enemies based on remaining HP

🖼️ Sprite-based UI with custom assets including panels, health bars, and victory/defeat screens

🖱️ Mouse interaction using hitboxes and a custom sword cursor for attacks

💬 Dynamic combat feedback with floating damage text and health updates

🔁 Reset functionality via a restart button for replayability

The game runs in a windowed environment and was built entirely with vanilla Pygame, making it a lightweight and educational example of how to build an RPG from the ground up.
